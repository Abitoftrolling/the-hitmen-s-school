    <h3> Now some words from our headmaster:</h3>
    <p> Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed faculty, and my dear students, </p>
    <p> My name is agent 47 and Today, I stand before you, not only as the headmaster of this esteemed institution but also as a mentor to some of the most talented and skilled individuals the world has ever seen. You all have been chosen for a very special reason, for you possess unique talents that go far beyond the boundaries of traditional education. In this hallowed institution, we strive for excellence, not just in academic pursuits, but in all aspects of life. We embrace a philosophy that is not commonly understood by the outside world. We are not just students; we are hitmen - professionals in the art of precision, stealth, and absolute mastery of our craft.

        It is true; I share a hidden identity with you all. While I stand here as your headmaster, I also embrace the life of a hitman, just like each one of you. The world is a complex web of challenges and threats, and we have been chosen to navigate through it in ways most can only imagine.
        
        Our calling is not for the faint-hearted. We walk a path that requires unwavering dedication, loyalty, and discretion. Our actions shape the course of events that remain hidden from public view. As hitmen, we carry a tremendous burden, but we also wield an incredible power - the power to influence the fate of nations, corporations, and individuals.</p>
    <p>This institution serves not only as a training ground for your abilities but also as a sanctuary where you can find camaraderie and understanding. We are a family bound by a shared secret and a shared purpose. Together, we shall grow stronger, and together, we shall make a lasting impact on the world. As for some parting words, my dear students, embrace your gifts, refine your skills, and carry yourselves with the utmost pride and humility. You are part of a legacy that stretches far beyond these walls. As you step out into the world, remember that you are not alone. We stand united in our quest for a better world. May your actions always be guided by wisdom and compassion, and may your resolve never waver in the face of adversity. Embrace your destinies, for you are the next generation of honorable hitmen, and the world shall never be the same again.</p>
    <p>Thank you, and may your journey together be one of valor, success, and unbreakable bonds!</p>
