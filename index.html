    <h3> Now some words from our headmaster:</h3>
    <p> Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed faculty, and my dear students, </p>
    <p> My name is agent E and Today, I stand before you, not only as the headmaster of this esteemed institution but also as a mentor to some of the most talented and skilled individuals the world has ever seen. You all have been chosen for a very special reason, for you possess unique talents that go far beyond the boundaries of traditional education. In this hallowed institution, we strive for excellence, not just in academic pursuits, but in all aspects of life. We embrace a philosophy that is not commonly understood by the outside world. We are not just students; we are hitmen - professionals in the art of precision, stealth, and absolute mastery of our craft.

        It is true; I share a hidden identity with you all. While I stand here as your headmaster, I also embrace the life of a hitman, just like each one of you. The world is a complex web of challenges and threats, and we have been chosen to navigate through it in ways most can only imagine.
        
        Our calling is not for the faint-hearted. We walk a path that requires unwavering dedication, loyalty, and discretion. Our actions shape the course of events that remain hidden from public view. As hitmen, we carry a tremendous burden, but we also wield an incredible power - the power to influence the fate of nations, corporations, and individuals.</p>
    <p>This institution serves not only as a training ground for your abilities but also as a sanctuary where you can find camaraderie and understanding. We are a family bound by a shared secret and a shared purpose. Together, we shall grow stronger, and together, we shall make a lasting impact on the world. As for some parting words, my dear students, embrace your gifts, refine your skills, and carry yourselves with the utmost pride and humility. You are part of a legacy that stretches far beyond these walls. As you step out into the world, remember that you are not alone. We stand united in our quest for a better world. May your actions always be guided by wisdom and compassion, and may your resolve never waver in the face of adversity. Embrace your destinies, for you are the next generation of honorable hitmen, and the world shall never be the same again.</p>
    <p>Thank you, and may your journey together be one of valor, success, and unbreakable bonds!</p>

    <h4>Now a word from our gracious sponsors that helped make this dream a reality:</h4>
    <p> When we first embarked on this journey to support the establishment of the Hitman's School, we envisioned creating a haven of education, training, and mentorship that would set new standards of proficiency and professionalism. Today, I can confidently say that this vision has not only become a reality, but it has exceeded our wildest dreams.

        The Hitman's School stands as a testament to the power of a hitman and the cultivation of those specialized skills. It is not merely a place of learning; it is a crucible of transformation, where individuals with raw potential are forged into virtuosos of their craft. The dedication of the faculty and staff, the state-of-the-art facilities, and the cutting-edge curriculum have come together in harmony, creating an unparalleled educational experience.
        
        As one of the sponsor talking here today, I have had the privilege of witnessing the students' remarkable journey firsthand. The commitment they demonstrate to their training, the discipline they embrace, and the ethical framework they develop are truly commendable. The Hitman's School instills in its students a profound sense of responsibility and discretion, emphasizing the importance of their roles in society as hitmen
        
        What sets the Hitman's School apart is not only its dedication to technical expertise but also its unwavering focus on the values of integrity, loyalty, and respect. These qualities define the true essence of a professional hitman, ensuring that they carry out their duties with a sense of honor and purpose.</p>
<br>

<p> The successful Assassination that have emerged from the Hitman's School are a testament to its efficacy. Graduates have gone on to make remarkable contributions to their employers and (eventually) society, and their adherence to ethical standards has set a new benchmark for the world of Assassination.

    None of this would have been possible without the collective efforts of us, the sponsors, whose belief in the power of fear and the potential for positive changes towards an unwavering hiearchy has made this endeavor a reality. Together, we have shaped the future of this unique field and paved the way for a new generation of highly skilled and principled professionals.
    
    In conclusion, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the sponsors, the dedicated faculty and staff, and the brilliant students of the Hitman's School of fine arts. It is your unwavering dedication, passion, and commitment to excellence that make this school truly exceptional.
    
    As we continue to support the Hitman's School, let us take immense pride in the impact it has on shaping not only the lives of its students but also the landscape of the profession they represent. Together, we are forging a brighter, more responsible future, where professionalism and ethics go hand in hand.
    
    Thank you all for being part of this remarkable journey, and may the legacy of the Hitman's School continue to thrive for generations to come.</p>
